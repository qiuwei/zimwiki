Personal wiki
=============

Here are some wiki-style notes I've made during the study and research. Most of them are related to programming and NLP.
Though I tried to make it structured, it wouldn't be helpful for anyone else other than me.
I also write blog posts when I feel I need to summarize the notes. http://blog.qiu.es. 

I use zim wiki to make it.
