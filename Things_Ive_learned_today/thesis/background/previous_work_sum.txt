There are 3 types of methods in previous literature:

=== retrieval and summarization: ===
\cite{Aker2010}: 
summarizer with use of GPS information.
Instead of using language model, they extract dependency patterns in order to capture long distance information 

=== language model based: ===

=== template based: ===
\cite{Hanckmann2012}
In this paper a Rule based system is used not only for the action classification but also for the description generation

48 actions : 73 rules
rules are a set of conditions

Example 1. Rule representing the catch action.
 action = chase 
condition(1) = object(E1) moving at time(T1)
condition(2) = object(E2) moving at time(T2)
condition(3) = object(E1) is a person
condition(4) = object(E2) is a person 
condition(5) = time(T1) and time(T2) overlap
Resulting sentence = “Person E1 chases Person E2”

COMMENT: 
for our situation, we can also use rules to capture "find" action?
or a more general statistical detector can be used?

Previous work on creating textual descriptions from video has been focused on:
* using speech recognition to genersate video subscriptions
* detecting and extracting text which is present  in the video
* detecting patterns in a restricted environment and use the detected patterns to generate a description

The third one is only applied in action restrcted environments( video data from sports in which strict rules apply, Detecting the state of the game directly translates in a description)
