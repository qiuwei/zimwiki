Grouding Action Descriptions in Videos

=== What we got in the corpus ===
* video segments with semantics(not well formed) and multiple sentence descriptions
* similartiy between those sentence descriptions, they call it verbs and phrases similarity model

=== Comparison with MSVD: ===
* high quality videos
* longer descriptions, each sentence is associated with one time frame

=== MPII, cooking composite activities corpus ===
Cooking domain, different activities:
* preparing corrots
* seperating eggs

What the corpus provides:
low level annotations: 
for example, 
open [hand, drawer]
take out [hand, knife, drawer]

The posistions are important, the first argument is subject, the second one is the object,  others are not determined(most of them are various other arguments)
There are 25 columns each line.

=== Vinter corpus ===
by adding textual description
open [hand, drawer] => "The person takes a knife from the drawer"
So, what in the corpus:
* aignments between video segements and textual description
* multiple textual descriptions can be consdiered as paraphrases
* alignments between textual descriptions and low-level activitiy annotations

All files in the corpus:
task-video-index:
